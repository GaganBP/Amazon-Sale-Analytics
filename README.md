# Amazon Sales Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Power BI project that I developed to visualize and analyze Amazon sales performance across multiple years, product categories, and U.S. states. The dashboard provides clear, insightful, and actionable information for understanding business performance at a glance.

The project is designed for business users, analysts, and decision-makers who want to track how different regions and categories are performing over time. With interactive filters and visuals, this dashboard helps drive strategic decisions using real sales data, transforming complex datasets into easily digestible visual insights.

## Features

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
KPIs are displayed prominently, showing:
- **Order Count** â€“ the total number of orders placed
- **Total Sales** â€“ total revenue generated from all orders
- **Total Profit** â€“ the net earnings after subtracting costs

### Time-Series Analysis
A time-series line chart visualizes sales trends on a daily level across selected years:
- Helps detect sales peaks and dips
- Useful for identifying seasonal patterns or campaign effectiveness

### Product Category Breakdown
A treemap chart shows total sales broken down by product categories:
- Visually highlights which categories contribute most to revenue
- Larger boxes indicate higher sales share

### State-wise Profit Analysis
A horizontal bar chart shows profit by U.S. state:
- Quickly identifies high-performing and low-performing states
- Red bars represent states with losses, green bars indicate profit

### Sales Performance Gauge
A sales gauge (or speedometer chart) shows progress toward a sales goal:
- Useful for comparing current performance to a benchmark

### Interactive Filtering
A year slicer allows users to select a specific year from 2011 to 2014:
- Dynamically filters all visuals to focus on that year's data

- A key indicator of business efficiency and financial health

## Key Insights from the Dashboard

- **California** leads in profit generation across all years, making it the top-performing state
- States like **Colorado**, **Oregon**, and **Arizona** consistently report losses, indicating potential issues in cost management or demand
- **Chairs**, **Phones**, and **Tables** are the top-selling product categories. These can be prioritized for promotions or inventory management
- Time-series trends show periodic spikes in sales, likely due to festive seasons or marketing campaigns
- The year-wise slicer allows stakeholders to analyze trends specific to a chosen year and compare performance over time
